The Task Tracker application is intended to help users organize tasks or responsibilities they may have using a combination of database storage and ChatGPT. In order to create a task list, users will need to create a login or sign in.

Once the task list has been created, users can generate recommendations on how to organize their tasks and a ChatGPT prompt will return the suggested order in which the items should be completed and why they should be completed that way.

From here, the user can delete tasks and task lists, and replace with new items. Once logged out, the user returns to the home page and can no longer view their added tasks.
